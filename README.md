## Easy Chord Progression Player

A minimalist React + Vite web app that helps musicians and music enthusiasts generate, play, and explore chord progressions interactively.


This project is built with:

- React for building the user interface

- Vite for fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

- Modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for clean, efficient code

The app allows users to generate random chord progressions or create their own sequences, play them back with audio, and experiment with musical ideas quickly.
